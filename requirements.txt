                WORK EXPERIENCE 
                (your most impressive thing needs to be first, period – i.e., no vague summaries)

                - Core responsibility #1 / key results / high-level summary.
                - Core responsibility #2. As your most recent past experience, you can build out a few bullet points here.
                - Core responsibility #3. Don’t feel the need to write too much about jobs from over 5 years in the past.

                Company Name									Month Year – Month Year

                - Core responsibility #2. As the jobs get older in your timeline, they’re less relevant and need fewer bullet points.

                Prior Job Title | Month, Year – Month, Year
                “Prior to my promotion to [current title], I…” core responsibility #1. Older job, less relevancy, 1 bullet is fine.
